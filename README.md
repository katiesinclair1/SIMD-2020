SIMD 2020 Data 
This project highlights data that relates high unemployment rates in Glasgow to education. Through the use and contribution of data from the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) 2020, a link has been made betwwen education and employment in the city. 
This project will help to steer policy decisions based on a community's requirements. It will help strengthen the link between education and employment, so that more poeple can pass through the education system picking up the essential skills needed to succeed.
This project can be used to identify areas in Glasgow with the lowest Education Domain rank and the lowest Employment Domain rank. Attainment levels can also be used, highlighting the gap between the highest and lowest rates in the city.
